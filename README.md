# CPU Scheduler Simulation

This project is a CPU scheduler simulation that visualizes various scheduling algorithms.

## Features

*   Simulates First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) scheduling algorithm.
*   Simulates Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm.
*   Interactive UI to add, remove, and update processes.
*   Visualizes process execution and calculates performance metrics (Average Waiting Time, Average Turnaround Time, Completed Jobs, Total Execution Time).

## Technologies

*   Svelte 5
*   Vite
*   Tailwind CSS v4
*   Bun (package manager)
